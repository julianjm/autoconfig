Apache configuration
====================

Declare the virtualhost with the ServerAlias wildcard: autoconfig.*
That would server all requests to any host name starting with autoconfig.

<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName autoconfig
        ServerAlias autoconfig.*
        DocumentRoot /var/www/autoconfig/
</VirtualHost>

DNS configuration
=================

Make sure you create a DNS record that points to your server.

autoconfig 		IN	A	1.2.3.4

A CNAME is useful, specially if you need to change the IP in the future:

autoconfig		IN	CNAME	autoconfig.myserver.com


Script configuration
====================

Copy the files to your document root, in this case /var/www/autoconfig/

Create a .htaccess file to redirect requests to /mail/config-v1.1.xml to
our multidomain.php script.

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^mail/config-v1\.1\.xml?$ multidomain.php?%{QUERY_STRING} [L]
</IfModule>


Using config.php.sample as a template, create config.php. Define your templates
and associate domain names with them.


TEST
====

Browse to: http://autodomain.YOURDOMAIN.COM/mail/config-v1.1.xml
If you get an XML file, it's time to try to create an account in Thunderbird
